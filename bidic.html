            <h4>Meet Dr. Bidic...</h4> 
            <p>I am truly fortunate because I love what I do. Making patients feel whole through reconstructive procedures and refining or enhancing an individual's natural beauty through aesthetic procedures is my passion.</p>

            <p>Long before I became a reconstructive and cosmetic plastic surgeon in Vineland, I was born and raised in southern New Jersey and went to college in Philadelphia. After 23 years of medical, surgical and artistic training and teaching in New York City, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles and Dallas, I am thankful to be back home in the Delaware Valley serving the fine people of this area and visitors from around the world.</p>

            <p>Throughout each step in my training, the underlying goal has been to become the most well rounded plastic and reconstructive surgeon possible. This includes spending five years practicing and teaching plastic surgery residents and hand surgery fellows as an Assistant Professor of Plastic Surgery at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.</p>

            <p>During the transition between my general and plastic surgery residency training in Pittsburgh, I utilized my "laboratory years" attaining a Masters in Fine Arts (MFA) from Carnegie Mellon University's School of Art. My focus on multimedia sculpture has permitted me to see the tissues of the body as distinct media. Fabric, clay, and marble are types of media as is skin, fat, and bone. Just as each individual work is original and different, so is each patient. We all share common human traits, but each one of us is an original with very individual body characteristics, life circumstances, and functional/aesthetic desires.</p>

           <p>As you peruse my practice's website, I would like you to notice that no paid models are on my pages – only my patients. Every patient becomes woven into the fabric of my practice. My patients inspire me; I appreciate our relationships and am proud of their results. I do not wish to treat a person who wants to be someone else, I wish to treat a person who strives to live a full life and be the best that she/he can be.</p>

           <p>From first visit to follow-up, my practice is structured so that I have time to spend with each patient so that I can understand their desires, educate them about their concerns and the available treatment methods, and create a plan that is tailored to achieve their goals. For those of you who choose me to assist in achieving your surgical goals, I appreciate your confidence and guarantee that I, and my team, will exhaust every effort and resource in delivering an exceptional experience and an extraordinary result.</p>
